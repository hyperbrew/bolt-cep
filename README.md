## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- Package manager either
  - NPM (comes with Node.js)
  - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) ( ensure by running `yarn set version classic` )
  - [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) ( ensure by running `pnpm --version` )

## Quick Start

<img src="src/js/assets/bolt-cep-cli.gif" alt="Bolt CEP">

Create your new Bolt CEP project (follow CLI prompts)

- yarn - `yarn create bolt-cep`
- npm - `npx create-bolt-cep`
- pnpm - `pnpm create-bolt-cep`

Change directory to the new project

- `cd project`

Install Dependencies (if not already done by create command)

- yarn - `yarn`
- npm - `npm i`
- pnpm - `pnpm i`

**⚠️ Enable PlayerDebugMode**

- Adobe CEP's PlayerDebugMode must be enabled on your machine to test `yarn build` or `yarn dev` builds. Only an installed ZXP with `yarn zxp` will work without PlayerDebugMode enabled.
  - Enable this easily with the [aescripts ZXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/) > Settings > Debug > Enable Debugging
  - Or enable manually per OS by following the CEP Cookbook Instructions: [Adobe CEP 12 Cookbook](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_12.x/Documentation/CEP%2012%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#debugging-unsigned-extensions)

Build the extension (must run before `dev`, can also run after for panel to work statically without the process) Symlink is created to extensions folder.

- yarn `yarn build`
- npm `npm run build`
- pnpm `pnpm build`

Run the extension in HMR Hot-reload mode for rapid development. Both JS and ExtendScript folders re-build on changes.
Viewable in browser via localhost:3000/panel/ (see [Panel Structure](#cep-panel-structure) to set up multiple panels)

- yarn `yarn dev`
- npm `npm run dev`
- pnpm `pnpm dev`

Build & Package the extension as a ZXP for delivery to the `dist/zxp` folder (install with [aescripts ZXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/) or another ZXP installer)

- yarn `yarn zxp`
- npm `npm run zxp`
- pnpm `pnpm zxp`

Bundles your packaged zxp file and specified assets from `copyZipAssets` to a zip archive in the `./zip` folder

- yarn `yarn zip`
- npm `npm run zip`
- pnpm `pnpm zip`

---

## Config

Update your CEP build and package settings in `cep.config.ts` safely typed

Start building your app per framework in:

- `src/js/main/main.tsx`
- `src/js/main/main.vue`
- `src/js/main/main.svelte`

Write ExtendScript code in `src/jsx/main.ts`

---

## CEP Panel Structure

Each panel is treated as it's own page, with shared code for efficiency. The Boilerplate currently comes with 2 panels, `main` and `settings`. These are configured in the `cep.config.ts`.

Each panel can be edited in their respective folders:

```
src
 └─ js
    ├─ main
    │   ├─ index.html
    |   └─ index.tsx
    └─ settings
        ├─ index.html
        └─ index.tsx
```

To add panels, add an item to the panels object in `cep.config.ts`, and duplicate the folder structure and adjust as needed.

---

## ExtendScript

ExtendScript can be written in ES6 and will be compiled down to a single ES3 file for compatibility.

JSON 2 is included by default, and any external JS libraries added with the include directive will be bundled as well:

```js
// @include './lib/library.js'
```

App-specific code is split into modules for type-safe development by the application's name as seen in the `index.ts`.

```
aftereffects >> aeft/aeft.ts
illustrator >> ilst/ilst.ts
animate >> anim/anim.ts
```

Write your app-specific functions in each of these separate modules, and they will be required per each application.

To add support for additional host apps:

- Add additional app module files (aeft.ts, anim.ts, etc).
- Extend the main `switch()` in `scr/jsx/index.ts` with your additional.
- Add the host to your `cep.config.ts` file.

---

## Calling ExtendScript from CEP JavaScript

All ExtendScript function are appended to your panel's namespace in the background to avoid namespace clashes when using `evalTS()` and `evalES()`.

We have now introduced a new and improved end-to-end type-safe way to interact with ExtendScript from CEP using `evalTS()`. This function dynamically infers types from
ExtendScript functions and handles both stringifying and parsing of the results so your developer interaction can be as simple as possible.

As demonstrated in `main.tsx`, your ExtendScript functions can be called with `evalTS()` by passing the name of the function, followed by the arguments.

CEP

```js
evalTS("myFunc", "test").then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});

evalTS("myFuncObj", { height: 90, width: 100 }).then((res) => {
  console.log(res.x);
  console.log(res.y);
});
```

ExtendScript

```js
export const myFunc = (str: string) => {
  return str;
};

export const myFuncObj = (obj: { height: number, width: number }) => {
  return {
    y: obj.height,
    x: obj.width,
  };
};
```

For any existing Bolt CEP projects, rest assured that the legacy `evalES()` function remains in place as usual as demonstrated in `main.tsx`.

```js
evalES(`helloWorld("${csi.getApplicationID()}")`);
```

You will also want to use this function for calling ExtendScript functions in the global scope directly, by passing `true` to the second parameter:

```js
evalES(
  `alert("Hello from ExtendScript :: " + app.appName + " " + app.version)`,
  true,
);
```

---

## Calling CEP JavaScript from ExtendScript

For certain situations such as hooking into event listeners or sending updates during long functions, it makes sense to trigger events from the ExtendScript environment to the JavaScript environment. This can be done with `listenTS()` and `dispatchTS()`.

Using this method accounts for:

- Setting up a scoped listener on the JS side for the CSEvent
- Setting up PlugPlug CSEvent event on ExtendScript side
- Ensuring End-to-End Type-Safety for the event

### 1. Declare the Event Type in EventTS in shared/universals.ts

```js
export type EventTS = {
  myCustomEvent: {
    oneValue: string,
    anotherValue: number,
  },
  // [... other events]
};
```

### 2. Listen in CEP JavaScript

```js
import { listenTS } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

listenTS("myCustomEvent", (data) => {
  console.log("oneValue is", data.oneValue);
  console.log("anotherValue is", data.anotherValue);
});
```

### 3. Dispatch in ExtendScript

```js
import { dispatchTS } from "../utils/utils";

dispatchTS("myCustomEvent", { oneValue: "name", anotherValue: 20 });
```

Alternatively, `dispatchTS()` can also be used in the same way from the CEP side to trigger events within or between CEP panels, just ensure you're importing the dispatchTS() function from the correct file within the `js` folder.

```js
import { dispatchTS } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

dispatchTS("myCustomEvent", { oneValue: "name", anotherValue: 20 });
```

## GitHub Actions ZXP Releases

This repo comes with a configured GitHub Action workflow to build a ZXP and add to the releases each time a git tag is added.

```
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin --tags
```

Then your new build will be available under GitHub Releases. For more info, see the [YML config](.github\workflows\main.yml)

---

---

## Copy Assets

If you have assets that you would like copied without being affected by the bundler, you can add the optional `copyAssets:[]` array inside your cep.config.ts to include files or entire folders.

```js
  copyAssets: ["public", "custom/my.jsx"],
```

**Example:**

Files placed in `src/public` will be copied to `dist/public` with config set to `copyAssets: ["public"]`.

---

---

## Copy Zip Assets

If you have assets that you would like copied with your zxp into a zip archive for delivery, you can add the optional `copyZipAssets:[]` array inside your cep.config.ts to include files or entire folders. A folder ending in "/\*" will copy the contents without the folder structure into the zip destination.

```js
  copyZipAssets: ["instructions/*", "icons"],
```

---

## Custom Ponyfills

Unlike Polyfills which modify the global prototype, Ponyfills replace functionality with custom methods. Built-in Ponyfills include:

- Object.freeze()
- Array.isArray()

You can add your own Ponyfils by passing them into the `jsxPonyfill()` function in `vite.es.config.ts`:

```js
jsxPonyfill([
  {
    find: "Array.isArray",
    replace: "__isArray",
    inject: `function __isArray(arr) { try { return arr instanceof Array; } catch (e) { return false; } };`,
  },
]);
```

If you have a common Ponyfill you feel should be built-in, create a ticket and we'll look into it.

---

## ExtendScript Scope

This boilerplate is flavored for a single JSX object attached to helper object `$` for all your panels to prevent pollution in the global namespace. If you prefer to include your own raw JSX, include it in the Copy Assets object (above), and add the optional scriptPath object to your cep.config.ts file.

```js
  panels: [
    {
      name: "main",
      scriptPath: "custom/index.jsx",
      [...]
    },
    {
      name: "settings",
      scriptPath: "custom/settings.jsx",
      [...]
    },
  ],
  copyAssets: ["custom"],
```

---

## Invisible Panels

To make one or more of your panels an invisible panel, aka hidden from the Extensions menu, make sure to leave the panelDisplayName as an empty string in `cep.config.ts`

```js
  panels: [
    {
      mainPath: "./main/index.html",
      name: "Invisible Bolt CEP",
      panelDisplayName: "",
      ...
    }
  ]
```

You'll want to ensure your panel can be launched from another panel with `csi.requestOpenExtension()` or with an auto-start event in `startOnEvents` in `cep.config.ts` event depending on the app:

```js
    startOnEvents: [
      "com.adobe.csxs.events.ApplicationActivate",
      "com.adobe.csxs.events.ApplicationInitialized",
      "applicationActivate",
    ],
```

Reference the [Adobe CEP Cookbook](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md) for more info on [invisible panels](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#invisible-html-extensions) and [CEP events](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#invisible-html-extensions)

---

## Troubleshooting Modules

Node.js Built-in modules can be imported from the `src/js/lib/node.ts` file.

```js
import { os, path, fs } from "../lib/node";
```

To use 3rd party libraries, first attempt to use with the standard import syntax.

```js
import { FaBolt } from "react-icons/fa";
```

If the import syntax fails (typically with modules that use the Node.js runtime) you can resort to the Node.js `require()` syntax,

```js
const unzipper = require("unzipper");
```

The build system will detect any non-built-in Node.js modules using `require()` and copy them to the output `node_modules` folder, but if a package is missed, you can add it explicitly to the `installModules:[]` array inside your `cep.config.ts` file.

```js
  installModules: ["unzipper"],
```

Also if they're Node.js-specific modules, it's best to place the requires inside functions so they are only required at runtime and don't break your panel when previewing in the browser.

---

## A Note on Routers

If you would like to set up a routing system like react-router, be aware that you'll have to make adjustments for CEP. React Router for instance bases the router path off of `window.location.pathname` which in the browser resolves to the page:

`/main/index.html`

yet in CEP context resolves to the full system path:

`file:///C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.bolt.cep/main/index.html`

To solve this, you'll need to adjust the router basename for each context, here is one way of accomplishing that with the panel named `main`:

```js
const posix = (str: string) => str.replace(/\\/g, "/");

const cepBasename = window.cep_node
  ? `${posix(window.cep_node.global.__dirname)}/`
  : "/main/";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router basename={cepBasename}>[...]</Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## Misc Troubleshooting

**Can't build JSXBIN on MacOS with PNPM**

There is a known bug with pnpm not running postinstall scripts [more info](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4649) [and here](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4649)

Since the [jsxbin](https://github.com/runegan/jsxbin) package requires the `postinstall` script, to fix this for now, cd into `node_modules/jsxbin` and run `pnpm run postinstall` to create the needed binaries. Now building JSXBIN will work successfully.

**React Spectrum won't allow certain UI items to be clicked on MacOS**:

There is an ongoing bug with React Spectrum and other UI libraries on MacOS with clicking elements. To resolve this issue, run the helper function `enableSpectrum()` to resolve this issue on Mac.

`main.ts`

```js
import { initBolt, enableSpectrum } from "../lib/utils/bolt";

enableSpectrum();
initBolt();
```

Additionally, some users have reported that adding the following CEF Flag will resolve the issue as well:

`cep.config.ts`

```js
...
parameters: [
  ...
  '--disable-site-isolation-trials'
  ],
...
```

**ZXPSignCmd Fails on Mac or Windows**:

4/18/2025 ZXPSignCmd broke on Windows across the board and on MacOS for most TSA services. ( [more info](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/zxpsigncmd-sign-process-is-broken-segmentation-fault/idc-p/15276912#M49107) )

4/30/2025 Adobe fixed the issues for Windows and MacOS, and we have included the updated ZXPSignCmd for both OS's in the latest release of `vite-cep-plugin@1.2.9`.

To use the latest in your existing Bolt CEP project, run `yarn add vite-cep-plugin`, and make sure your `zxp.tsa` settings in `cep.config.ts` match the [latest format](./cep.config.ts).

**Build Issues on Mac Arm64 Apple Silicon Machines (M1/M2/M3)**

5/13/2025 - jsxbin is now natively supported on Apple Silicon machines. More info here: [Setup ExtendScript Dev for Apple Silicon Macs](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/adobe-extendscript-support-for-apple-silicon/)

**Update a Bolt CEP Project** To update an existing Bolt CEP project to the the latest version, create a new Bolt CEP project with the same framework (React, Vue, Svelte), then compare and update the following files:

1. `package.json` - Update all dependencies and scripts ( `vite-cep-plugin` - usually contains the most frequent updates ). Make sure to re-install dependencies after updating.
2. `vite.config.ts` - Unless you've modified the vite config yourself, you can just copy the contents of the latest into yours.
3. `vite.es.config.ts` - Like the previous config, unless you've modified it yourself, you can just copy the contents of the latest into yours.
4. `cep.config.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.
5. `src/js/lib` - Update this entire folder.
6. `src/js/main/index.html` - Update the index HTML file
7. `src/js/main/index-[framework].[ext]` - Update the index file for your framework (React, Vue, Svelte)
8. `src/jsx/index.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.
9. `src/shared/universals.d.ts` - Check if any new properties have been added that don't exist in your config.

**ZXPSignCmd Permissions issues on Mac**:

Previously, you would need to fix the permissions of ZXPSignCmd by running the following command in the terminal, however this is now automated since `vite-cep-plugin@1.1.15`. If you still experience problems other reasons you can manually fix the executable as follows:

If you're getting permissions errors running ZXPSignCmd on the latest Mac releases, try a fresh clone. If that does't work, reset permissions for ZXPSignCmd by opening the directory `node_modules/vite-cep-plugin/lib/bin` and running `chmod 700 ./ZXPSignCmd`.
